EML is written in XML (extensible markup language) and functions for building and editing EML are in the EML R package. For additional background on EML and principles for metadata creation, check out this paper. The first task when editing an eml file is navigating the eml file. An eml file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. The function EML::eml_view() (install.packages(&quot;listviewer&quot;) if it doesn’t work) allows you to get a crude view of an eml file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file. To navigate this complex structure in R, use the @ symbol. The @ symbol allows you to go deeper into the eml structure and to see what slots are nested within other slots. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the @ symbol. For example, if you want to go into the dataset of your eml you would use the command eml@dataset. If you want to go to the creators of your data set you would use eml@dataset@creator. Note here that creators are contained within dataset. If you aren’t sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing @ and a list of available locations in the structure will appear (e.g., eml@&lt;TAB&gt;): RStudio Autocompletion Example Note if you hit tab, and the only option is .Data, this implies most likely that you are trying to go deeper within a list. For example eml@dataset@creator@&lt;TAB&gt; will return only .Data. This is because creator is a list object (i.e. you can have multiple creators). If you want to go deeper into creator, you first must tell R which creator you are interested in. Do this by writing [[i]] first where i is index of the creator you are concerned with. For example, if you want to look at the first creator i = 1. Now eml@dataset@creator[[1]]@&lt;TAB&gt; will give you many more options. Note, .Data also sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the eml structure. Understand the EML schema Another great resource for navigating the eml structure is looking at the schema which defines the structure. The .png files on this page show the schema as a diagram. Additional information on the schema and how different elements are defined can be found here). However, the schema is complicated and may take some time to get familiar with before you will be able to fully understand it. For example, let’s take a look at eml-party. To start off, notice that some elements are in solid boxes, whereas others are in dashed boxes. A solid box indicates that the element is required if the element above it (to the left in the schema) is used, whereas a dashed box indicates that the element is optional. Notice also that below the givenName element it says “0..infinity”. This means that the element is unbounded — a single party can have many given names and there is no limit on how many you can add. However, this text does not appear for the surName element — a party can have only one surname. You will also see icons linking the eml slots together which indicate the ordering of subsequent slots. These can indicate either a “sequence” or a “choice”. In our example from eml-party, a “choice” icon indicates that either an individualName, organizationName, or positionName is required, but you do not need all three. However, the “sequence” icon tells us that if you use an individualName, you must include the surName as a child element. If you include the optional child elements salutation and givenName, they must be written in the order presented in the schema. The eml schema sections you may find particularly helpful include eml-party, eml-attribute, and eml-physical. For a more detailed description of the eml schema, see the reference section on exploring EML. "],

["edit-an-eml-element.html", "Edit an EML element", " Edit an EML element There are multiple ways to edit an EML element. Edit EML with strings The most basic way to edit an EML element would be to go into the eml schema to the location of a character string and then replace that character string with a new character string. For example to change the title one could use the following commands. new_title &lt;- &quot;New Title&quot; eml@dataset@title[[1]]@.Data &lt;- new_title However, this isn’t the best method to edit the EML unless you are an expert both in S4 objects and in the EML schema, since the nesting and lists of elements can get very complex. Edit EML with EML For editing simple text sections, a better option is to use EML::read_eml. To use this function, one would first run the slot that is in need of editing. For example, for a title this would involve calling eml@dataset@title[[1]] and then copying the result. In this case, the result will be of the form &lt;title&gt;Title Text Here&lt;/title&gt;. To make a new title, one would replace the text between the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; tags using a similar workflow as below. new_title &lt;- EML::read_eml(&quot;&lt;title&gt;New Title 2&lt;/title&gt;&quot;) eml@dataset@title[[1]] &lt;- new_title Note, without specifying which title with [[1]], the following code will give you the error Error in (function (cl, name, valueClass) : assignment of an object of class “title” is not valid for @‘title’ in an object of class “dataset”; is(value, &quot;ListOftitle&quot;) is not TRUE. # Bad Example new_title &lt;- EML::read_eml(&quot;&lt;title&gt;New Title 2&lt;/title&gt;&quot;) eml@dataset@title &lt;- new_title The above gives an error because eml@dataset@title is a slot for a list and new_title is a single object. Therefore you must either specify which title you want to replace as was done above by specifying the first title in the list with [[1]] or turn new_title into a list/vector utilizing the c() command as follows. new_title &lt;- EML::read_eml(&quot;&lt;title&gt;New Title 2&lt;/title&gt;&quot;) eml@dataset@title &lt;- c(new_title) However, if there were multiple titles, the above would replace all the titles with the single title. This behavior may or may not be desirable so be careful. One final note, a benefit of this method to edit EML objects is that advanced text features can be easily added using this workflow. Edit EML with objects A final way to edit an EML element would be to build a new object to replace the old object. To begin, you must determine the class of the object you want to edit (generally this is just the schema name of the object). The function class() is helpful here. For example, if you want to edit eml@dataset@title[[1]] use the following command to find the class. class(eml@dataset@title[[1]]) The result shows that this object has a class title. Therefore you must replace it with an object of class title. To do so use as(). To use as() input the the desired string followed by the desired class. new_title &lt;- as(&quot;New Title 3&quot;, &quot;title&quot;) eml@dataset@title[[1]] &lt;- new_title #or eml@dataset@title &lt;- c(new_title) Note, if you want to create an object with nested objects, you may have to use the command new() which is similar to as() but with the order of specifying values and class switched. See help on editing datatables for an example of when to use new(). "],

Optional. e.g.: “Temperature (Celsius)” attributeDefinition: Longer description of the attribute, including the required context for interpreting the attributeName. Required. e.g.: “The near shore water temperature in the upper inter-tidal zone, measured in degrees Celsius.” measurementScale: One of: nominal, ordinal, dateTime, ratio, interval. Required. nominal: unordered categories or text. e.g.: (Male, Female) or (Yukon River, Kuskokwim River) ordinal: ordered categories. e.g.: Low, Medium, High dateTime: date or time values from the Gregorian calendar. e.g.: 01-01-2001 ratio: measurement scale with a meaningful zero point in nature. Ratios are proportional to the measured variable. e.g.: 0 Kelvin represents a complete absence of heat. 200 Kelvin is half as hot as 400 Kelvin. 1.2 meters per second is twice as fast as 0.6 meters per second. interval: values from a scale with equidistant points, where the zero point is arbitrary. This is usually reserved for degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, or latitude and longitude coordinates, or any other human-constructed scale. e.g.: there is still heat at 0° Celsius; 12° Celsius is NOT half as hot as 24° Celsius domain: One of: textDomain, enumeratedDomain, numericDomain, dateTimeDomain. Required. textDomain: text that is free-form, or matches a pattern enumeratedDomain: text that belongs to a defined list of codes and definitions. e.g.: CASC = Cascade Lake, HEAR = Heart Lake dateTimeDomain: dateTime attributes numericDomain: attributes that are numbers (either ratio or interval) formatString: Required for dateTimeDomain, NA otherwise. Format string for dates, e.g. “MM/DD/YYYY”. definition: Required for textDomain, NA otherwise. Definition for attributes that are a character string, matches attribute definition in most cases. unit: Required for numericDomain, NA otherwise. Unit string. If the unit is not a standard unit, a warning will appear when you create the attribute list, saying that it has been forced into a custom unit. Use caution here to make sure the unit really needs to be a custom unit. A list of standard units can be found here: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/./eml-unitTypeDefinitions.html#StandardUnitDictionary numberType: Required for numericDomain, NA otherwise. Options are “real”, “natural”, “whole”, “integer”. real: positive and negative fractions and non fractions (…-1,-0.25,0,0.25,1…) natural: non-zero positive counting numbers (1,2,3…) whole: positive counting numbers and zero (0,1,2,3…) integer: positive and negative counting numbers and zero (…-2,-1,0,1,2…) missingValueCode: Code for missing values (e.g.: ‘-999’, ‘NA’, ‘NaN’). NA otherwise. Note that an NA missing value code should be a string, ‘NA’, and numbers should also be strings, ‘-999.’ missingValueCodeExplanation: Explanation for missing values, NA if no missing value code exists.

Luckily, there is a shiny app that you can use to build attribute information. You can use the app to build attributes from a data file loaded into R (recommended as the app will auto-fill some fields for you), or to edit an existing attribute table, or create attributes from scratch using the following commands (the commands will launch a shiny app in your web browser). # From data (recommended) datamgmt::create_attributes_table(data = data) # From an attribute table datamgmt::create_attributes_table(attributes_table = attributes_table) # From scratch datamgmt::create_attributes_table() Once you are done editing a table in the app, click the Print button to print text of a code that will build a data frame in R. Copy that code and assign it to a variable in your script (e.g. attributes &lt;- data.frame(...)). Edit Custom Units If you have units that are not in the standard EML unit list, you will need to build a custom unit list. To determine if your units are standard or not you can look through the standard units by using the following commands. standardUnits &lt;- get_unitList() View(standardUnits$units) Additionally, datamgmt::create_attributes_table will tell you if each of your units are standard or not. If your unit is not standard, you should use the following code to help auto-generate a custom unit. datamgmt::get_custom_units(&quot;your_unit&quot;) Note, datamgmt::create_attributes_table calls datamgmt::get_custom_units for you! Custom units need to have the following columns. id unitType parentSI multiplierToSI abbreviation definition datamgmt::get_custom_units will auto-generate many of these fields for you (but don’t just assume the autogeneration will be perfect, always ensure the autogeneration correctly handles your unit) Edit Factors For attributes that are enumeratedDomains, a table is needed with three columns: attributeName, code, and definition. attributeName should be the same as the attributeName within the attribute table and repeated for all codes belonging to a common attribute. code should contain all unique values of the given attributeName that exist within the actual data. definition should contain a plain text definition that describes each code. There is a tab in the datamgmt::create_attributes_table app that will help you build factors. If you need to build factors by hand, you can use named character vectors and then convert them to a data frame as shown in the example below. In this example, there are two enumerated domains in the attribute list - “Location” and “Region” Location &lt;- c(CASC = &#39;Cascade Lake&#39;, CHIK = &#39;Chikumunik Lake&#39;, HEAR = &#39;Heart Lake&#39;, NISH = &#39;Nishlik Lake&#39; ) Region &lt;- c(W_MTN = &#39;West region, locations West of Eagle Mountain&#39;, E_MTN = &#39;East region, locations East of Eagle Mountain&#39;) The definitions are then written into a data frame using the names of the named character vectors, and their definitions. factors &lt;- rbind(data.frame(attributeName = &#39;Location&#39;, code = names(Location), definition = unname(Location)), data.frame(attributeName = &#39;Region&#39;, code = names(Region), definition = unname(Region))) Finalize attributeList Once you have built your attributes, factors, and custom units, you can add them to eml objects. Attributes and factors are combined to form an attributeList using the following command. attributeList &lt;- EML::set_attributes(attributes = attributes, factors = factors) This attributeList must then be added to a dataTable. Custom units are added to additionalMetadata using the following command. unitlist &lt;- set_unitList(custom_units) eml@additionalMetadata &lt;- c(as(unitlist, &quot;additionalMetadata&quot;)) "],

["explore-eml-1.html", "Explore EML", " Explore EML The first task when editing an eml file is navigating the eml file. An eml file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. The function EML::eml_view() (install.packages(&quot;listviewer&quot;) if it doesn’t work) allows you to get a crude view of an eml file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file. To navigate this complex structure in R, use the @ symbol. The @ symbol allows you to go deeper into the eml structure. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the @ symbol. For example, if you want to go into the dataset of your eml you would use the command eml@dataset. If you want to go to the creators of your data set you would use eml@dataset@creator. Note here that creators are contained within dataset. If you aren’t sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing @ and a list of available locations in the structure will appear (e.g., eml@&lt;TAB&gt;): RStudio Autocompletion Example Note if you hit tab, and the only option is .Data, this implies most likely that you are trying to go deeper within a list. For example eml@dataset@creator@&lt;TAB&gt; will return only .Data. This is because creator is a list object (i.e. you can have multiple creators). If you want to go deeper into the eml structure, you first must tell R which creator you are interested in. Do this by writing [[i]] first where i is index of the creator you are concerned with. For example, if you want to look at the first creator i = 1. Now eml@dataset@creator[[1]]@&lt;TAB&gt; will give you many more options. Note, .Data also sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the eml structure. Another great resource for navigating the eml structure is looking at the schema which defines the structure (also here). However, the schema is complicated and may take some time to get familiar with before you will be able to fully understand it. For example, let’s take a look at eml-party. To start off, notice that some elements are in solid boxes, whereas others are in dashed boxes. A solid box indicates that the element is required if the element above it (to the left in the schema) is used, whereas a dashed box indicates that the element is optional. For a more detailed description of the eml schema, see the reference section on exploring EML. Access specific elements The eml_get function is a powerful tool for exploring EML (more on that here). It takes any chunk of eml and returns all instances of the element you specify. Note: you’ll have to specify the element of interest exactly, according to the spelling/capitalization conventions used in EML. Here are some examples: library(EML) eml &lt;- EML::read_eml(system.file(&quot;example-eml.xml&quot;, package = &quot;arcticdatautils&quot;)) EML::eml_get(eml, &quot;creator&quot;) ## [[1]] ## An object of class &quot;ListOfcreator&quot; ## [[1]] ## &lt;creator system=&quot;uuid&quot;&gt; ## &lt;individualName&gt; ## &lt;givenName&gt;Bryce&lt;/givenName&gt; ## &lt;surName&gt;Mecum&lt;/surName&gt; ## &lt;/individualName&gt; ## &lt;organizationName&gt;National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis&lt;/organizationName&gt; ## &lt;/creator&gt; EML::eml_get(eml, &quot;boundingCoordinates&quot;) ## &lt;boundingCoordinates&gt; ## &lt;westBoundingCoordinate&gt;-135&lt;/westBoundingCoordinate&gt; ## &lt;eastBoundingCoordinate&gt;-134&lt;/eastBoundingCoordinate&gt; ## &lt;northBoundingCoordinate&gt;59&lt;/northBoundingCoordinate&gt; ## &lt;southBoundingCoordinate&gt;57&lt;/southBoundingCoordinate&gt; ## &lt;/boundingCoordinates&gt; EML::eml_get(eml, &quot;url&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ecogrid://knb/urn:uuid:89bec5d0-26db-48ac-ae54-e1b4c999c456&quot; You can also use the which_in_eml function from the datamgmt package to get indices within an eml list. Here are some examples: # Question: Which creators have a surName &quot;Smith&quot;? n &lt;- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@creator, &quot;surName&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot;) # Answer: eml@dataset@creator[n] # Question: Which dataTables have an entityName that begins with &quot;2016&quot; n &lt;- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@dataTable, &quot;entityName&quot;, function(x) {grepl(&quot;^2016&quot;, x)}) # Answer: eml@dataset@dataTable[n] # Question: Which attributes in dataTable[[1]] have a numberType &quot;natural&quot;? n &lt;- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList@attribute, &quot;numberType&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;) # Answer: eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList@attribute[n] #&#39; # Question: Which dataTables have at least one attribute with a numberType &quot;natural&quot;? n &lt;- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@dataTable, &quot;numberType&quot;, function(x) {&quot;natural&quot; %in% x}) # Answer: eml@dataset@dataTable[n] "],

["use-references.html", "Use references", " Use references Introduction References are a way to avoid repeating the same information multiple times in the same EML record. There are a few benefits to doing this, including: Making it clear that two things are the same (e.g., the creator is the same person as the contact, two entities have the exact same attributes) Reducing the size on disk of EML records with highly redundant information Faster read/write/validate with the R EML package You may want to use EML references if you have the following scenarios (not exhaustive): One person has multiple roles in the dataset (creator, contact, etc) One or more entities shares all or some attributes Example with parties It’s very common to see the contact and creator referring to the same person with XML like this: ## &lt;eml packageId=&quot;my_test_doc&quot; system=&quot;my_system&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1 eml.xsd&quot;&gt; ## &lt;dataset&gt; ## &lt;creator&gt; ## &lt;individualName&gt; ## &lt;givenName&gt;Bryce&lt;/givenName&gt; ## &lt;surName&gt;Mecum&lt;/surName&gt; ## &lt;/individualName&gt; ## &lt;/creator&gt; ## &lt;contact&gt; ## &lt;individualName&gt; ## &lt;givenName&gt;Bryce&lt;/givenName&gt; ## &lt;surName&gt;Mecum&lt;/surName&gt; ## &lt;/individualName&gt; ## &lt;/contact&gt; ## &lt;/dataset&gt; ## &lt;/eml&gt; So you see those two times Bryce Mecum is referenced there? If you mean to state that Bryce Mecum is the creator and contact for the dataset, this is a good start. But with just a name, there’s some ambiguity as to whether the creator and contact are truly the same person. Using references, we can remove all doubt. eml@dataset@creator[[1]]@id &lt;- new(&quot;xml_attribute&quot;, &quot;reference_id&quot;) eml@dataset@contact[[1]] &lt;- new(&quot;contact&quot;, reference = &quot;reference_id&quot;) print(eml) ## &lt;eml packageId=&quot;my_test_doc&quot; system=&quot;my_system&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1 eml.xsd&quot;&gt; ## &lt;dataset&gt; ## &lt;creator id=&quot;reference_id&quot;&gt; ## &lt;individualName&gt; ## &lt;givenName&gt;Bryce&lt;/givenName&gt; ## &lt;surName&gt;Mecum&lt;/surName&gt; ## &lt;/individualName&gt; ## &lt;/creator&gt; ## &lt;contact&gt; ## &lt;references&gt;reference_id&lt;/references&gt; ## &lt;/contact&gt; ## &lt;/dataset&gt; ## &lt;/eml&gt; The reference id needs to be unique within the EML record but doesn’t need to have meaning outside of that. Example with attributes To use references with attributes: Add an attribute list to a data table Add a reference id for that attribute list Use references to add that information into the attributeLists of the other data tables For example, if all the data tables in our data package have the same attributes, we can set the attribute list for the first one, and use references for the rest: eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList &lt;- attribute_list eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList@id &lt;- new(&quot;xml_attribute&quot;, &quot;shared_attributes&quot;) for (i in 2:length(eml@dataset@dataTable)) { ref &lt;- new(&quot;references&quot;, &quot;shared_attributes&quot;) eml@dataset@dataTable[[i]]@attributeList@references &lt;- ref } Want more info? See more in-depth examples here. Add creator IDs The datamgmt::add_creator_id() function is a shortcut for one of our most common use-cases: you get a package that does not have an ORCID associated with any of the contacts, and you need to add at least one into the metadata. To do this, you can: Add the ORCID to a creator (usually the first creator) Update the contact information for that individual’s other roles eml &lt;- eml %&gt;% datamgmt::add_creator_id(surname = &quot;mecum&quot;, orcid = &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-1234-5678-4321&quot;, id = &quot;bryce&quot;) # Use references to add updated contact info to Henrietta&#39;s other roles eml@dataset@contact[[1]] &lt;- new(&#39;contact&#39;, reference = &quot;bryce&quot;) eml@dataset@metadataProvider[[1]] &lt;- new(&#39;metadataProvider&#39;, reference = &quot;bryce&quot;) Updated creator information cannot be used as a reference for associatedParties because the extra “role” field is required. Also, the function does not (yet) account for cases in which multiple creators have the same surname. Check out the help file for add_creator_id for more information: ?datamgmt::add_creator_id "],

Here are some training materials we have that use both the dataone and datapack packages. It explains how to set your authentication token, build a package from metadata and data files, and publish the package to one of our test sites. I definitely recommend practicing on a test site prior to publishing to the production site your first time through. You can point to the KNB test node (dev.nceas.ucsb.edu) using this command: d1c &lt;- D1Client(&quot;STAGING2&quot;, &quot;urn:node:mnTestKNB&quot;) If you prefer, there are Java, Python, Matlab, and Bash/cURL clients as well. Nesting Nesting data sets under a common “parent” is beneficial so that all data sets funded by the same award can be found in one place. This way additional data sets can be added to the group without altering existing ones. Once we process all the “child” data sets you upload, we can group them under the same “parent”. The parent will not contain any data files itself, but will be populated with metadata only. Please view an example of a parent data set here. Would you like your submission(s) grouped with the other data sets funded by the same award? If so, we are happy to do all this grouping for you. Finding multiple data sets If linking to multiple data sets, you can send a link to the profile associated with the submitter’s ORCID ID and it will display all the data sets. Ex.: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#profile/http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2604-4533 NSF ARC data submission policy The NSF ARC program managers check compliance with their data policies when checking annual reports. Generally, NSF ARC requires that fully quality controlled data be uploaded within 6 months of collection for AON projects, or within 2 years of collection (or by end of the grant) for other ARC funded projects. Additionally, complete metadata must be submitted within two years of collection or before the end of the award, whichever comes first. Please find an overview of the NSF ARC policies &gt;here and the full policy information &gt;here. Investigators should upload their data to the Arctic Data Center, or, where appropriate, to another community endorsed data archive that ensures the longevity, interpretation, public accessibility, and preservation of the data (e.g., GenBank, NCEI). Local and university web pages generally are not sufficient as an archive. Data preservation should be part of the institutional mission and data must remain accessible even if funding for the archive wanes (i.e., succession plans are in place). We would be happy to discuss the suitability of various archival locations with you further. In order to provide a central location for discovery of ARC-funded data, a metadata record must always be uploaded to the Arctic Data Center even when another community archive is used. Final email templates Asking for approval Hi PI, I have updated your data set and you can view it here after logging in: [URL] Please review and approve it for publishing or let us know if you would like anything else changed. For your convenience, if we do not hear from you within a week we will proceed with publishing. DOI and data set finalization comments Replying to questions about DOIs &gt;We attribute DOIs to data sets as one might give a DOI to a citable publication. Thus, a DOI is permanently associated with a unique and immutable version of a data set. If the data set changes, a new DOI will be created and the old DOI will be preserved with the original version. DOIs and URLs for previous versions of data sets remain active on the Arctic Data Center (will continue to resolve to the data set landing page for the specific version they are associated with), but a clear message will appear at the top of the page stating that “A newer version of this dataset exists” with a hyperlink to that latest version. With this approach, any past uses of a DOI (such as in a publication) will remain functional and will reference the specific version of the dataset that was cited, while pointing users to the newest version if one exists. Clarification of updating with a DOI and version control &gt;We definitely support updating a data set that has already been assigned a DOI, but when we do so we mark it as a new revision that replaces the original and give it its own DOI. We do that so that any citations of the original version of the data set remain valid (i.e.: after the update, people still know exactly which data were used in the work citing it).

We are here to help you publish your submission, but your continued assistance is needed to do so. See comments below: [COMMENTS HERE] Best, [YOUR NAME] Poor title Provides the what, where, and when of the data We would like to add some more context to your data package title. A descriptive title that provides context about the what, where, and when of a data package is often far more useful in search results. Something like: ‘OUR SUGGESTION HERE, WHERE, WHEN’ might be an option. Does not use acronyms We noticed that your title contains several acronyms or abbreviations. In order to increase discoverability of your title, please spell out all acronyms and abbreviations. Poor abstract Describes DATA in package (ideally &gt; 100 words) Your abstract, while informative, appears to be missing some information. We suggest that the abstract be sufficiently descriptive for a general scientific audience. It should provide an overview of the scientific context/ project/ hypotheses, how this data package fits into the larger project, a synopsis of the experimental or sampling design, and a summary of the data contents. If you prefer and it is appropriate, we could add language from the abstract in the NSF Award found here: [NSF AWARD URL]. Poor data At least one data file We noticed that no data files were submitted. With the exception of sensitive social science data, NSF requires the submission of all data products prior to publication. Do you intend to submit data files?

Based on the NSF awards, your most recent submission and the [PACKAGE NAME] package appear to be related. Would you like your submission(s) grouped with the other data packages funded by the same award? If so, we are happy to do all this grouping for you. Thank you for your submission to the Arctic Data Center! Based on the NSF awards, your most recent submission and the [PACKAGE NAME] parent package seem like disparate projects, is that correct? Nesting data packages under a common “parent” is beneficial so that all packages funded by the same award can be found in one place. This way additional packages can be added to the group without altering existing ones. Once we process all the “child” data packages you upload, we can group them under the same “parent”. The parent does not need to contain any data files itself, but will be populated with metadata only. Poor methods Submissions should: provide instrument names specify how sampling locations were chosen provide citations for sampling methods that are not explained in detail Your methods, while informative, appear to be missing some information. Enough detail should be included so that a reasonable scientist can interpret the study and data for reuse without consulting you nor any other resources. This should hold true today, or even decades or a century from now. Users need to understand how the data were collected, how to interpret the values, and potentially how to use the data in the case of specialized files. We would be happy to add more content for you. Please provide us with a more robust methods section directly in this email or point us to a document from which we can extract more methods. NSF requires that comprehensive methods information be included directly in the metadata record. Pointers or URLs to other sites are unstable and insufficient. "],

["pi-faqs.html", "PI FAQs", " PI FAQs Q: Can I replace data that has already been uploaded and keep the DOI? A: Once you have published your data with the Arctic Data Center, it can still be updated by providing an additional version which can replace the original, while still preserving the original and making it available to anyone who might have cited it. To update your data, return to the data submission tool used to submit it, and provide an update. Any update to a data set qualifies as a new version and therefore requires a new DOI. This is because each DOI represents a unique, immutable version, just like for a journal article. DOIs and URLs for previous versions of data sets remain active on the Arctic Data Center (will continue to resolve to the data set landing page for the specific version they are associated with), but a clear message will appear at the top of the page stating that “A newer version of this data set exists” with a hyperlink to the latest version. With this approach, any past uses of a DOI (such as in a publication) will remain functional and will reference the specific version of the data set that was cited, while pointing users to the newest version if one exists. Q: Why don’t I see the data set that I uploaded to the ADC? Possible Answer #1: The data set is still private because we are awaiting your approval to publish it. Please login with your ORCID ID to view private data sets. Possible Answer #2: The data set is still private and you do not have access because you were not the submitter. If you need access please have the submitter send us a message from his/her email address confirming this, along with your ORCID ID. Once we receive that confirmation we will be happy to grant you permission to view and edit the data set. Possible Answer #3: The data set is still private and we accidentally failed to grant you access. I apologize for the mistake. I have since updated the access policy. Please let us know if you are still having trouble viewing this data set here: (URL). Remember to login with your ORCID ID. Issue: I would like to display multiple geographic coverages for my data set, but the form only accepts one point or bounding box. Unfortunately, the current web form does not allow users to input more than one geographic coverage. We are happy to add multiple coverages (maps) for you. Please provide us with the coordinates. Note that next version of the web form will support the addition of multiple locations by users. We anticipate this release in the coming months. Issue: MANY files to upload (100s or 1000s). A: Please consider zipping the files up for transfer. Can you upload the files to a drive we can access, such as G Drive or Dropbox? Alternatively, if you have a publicly accessible FTP you can point us to, we could grab the files from there. If needed, we have a secure FTP you can access. Details are available here. Please access our server at datateam.nceas.ucsb.edu with the username “visitor”. Let us know if you would like to use our SFTP and we will send you the password and the path to which directory to upload to. Q: May another person (e.g. my student) submit data using my ORCID ID so that it is linked to me? A: I would recommend instead that the student set up their own ORCID accounts at https://ORCiD.org/register and submit data sets from that account. Submissions are processed by our team and, at that point, we can grant you full rights to the metadata and data files even though another person submitted them. Issue: Web form not cooperating. A: I apologize that you are experiencing difficulties while attempting to submit your data set. We are happy to attempt to troubleshoot this for you. Which operating system (including the version) and browser (with version #) are you using? At which exact step did the issue arise. What error message did you receive? Please provide us with any screenshots of the error message. Q: May I submit a non-NSF funded data set? A: Yes, you can submit non-NSF-funded Arctic data if you are willing to submit under the licensing terms of the Arctic Data Center (CC-0 or CC-BY), the data are moderately sized (with exact limits open to discussion), and a lot of support time to curate the submission is not required (i.e., you submit a complete metadata record and well formatted, open-source data files). For larger data sets, we would likely need to charge a one-time archival fee which amortizes the long-term costs of preservation in a single payment. Also, please note that NSF-funded projects take priority when it comes to processing. Information on best practices for data and metadata organization is available here. Q: Can I add another data file to an existing submission without having to fill out another metadata form? A: Yes. Navigate to the data set after being sure to login. Then click the green “Edit” button. The form will populate with the already existing metadata so there is no need to fill it out again. Just scroll to the bottom of the form to “Upload Data”, click “Choose File”, and browse to the data file you wish to add. Be aware that the DOI will need to change after you add this file (or make any changes to a data set) as, just like for a journal article, a DOI represents a unique and immutable version. The current URL will remain functional, but clearly display a message at the top of that page stating “A newer version of this data set exists” with a link to the latest version. Q: Can I add these data anytime or is there some deadline associated with the grant, or some other restriction I’m not aware of? A: We are happy to accept your submission any time; however, NSF has stricter policies. For all ARC supported projects, the policies state that “Complete metadata must be submitted… within two years of collection or before the end of the award, whichever comes first. All data and derived data products that are appropriate for submission… must be submitted within two years of collection or before the end of the award, whichever comes first.” For all AON projects, “Real-time data must be made publicly available immediately. All data must be submitted… within 6 months of collection, and be fully quality controlled. All data sets and derived data products must be accompanied by a metadata profile and full documentation.” Q: Can you clarify what constitutes sensitive information (in relation to social science data and whether it needs to be uploaded)? A: Sensitive information includes human subjects data and data that are governed by an Institutional Review Board policy. Data that are ethically or legally sensitive or at risk of decontextualization also constitute sensitive information. The NSF policy states “NSF realizes that on occasion there are data gathered of a particularly sensitive nature, such as the locations of archaeological sites or nest locations of endangered species. It is not the intention of this policy to reveal such information publicly. Discipline standards, indigenous community cultural rules, and state and federal regulations and laws should be followed for these types of data.” The full policies are available here. Q: Can we submit data as an Excel file? A: While the Arctic Data Center supports the upload of any data file format, sharing data can be greatly enhanced if you use ubiquitous, easy-to-read formats. For instance, while Microsoft Excel files are commonplace, it is better to export these spreadsheets to Comma Separated Values (CSV) text files, which can be read on any computer without needing to have Microsoft products installed. Data submitted in Excel workbooks will undergo conversion to CSVs by our staff before being made public. So, yes, you are free to submit an Excel workbook, however we strongly recommend converting each sheet to a CSV. The goal is not only for users to be able to read data files, but to be able to analyze them with software, such as R Studio. Typically, we would extract any plots and include them as separate image files. [ONLY SAY THIS NEXT PART IF THE PI CONTINUES TO INSIST] I understand that having the plots in the same file as the data they are built from simplifies organization. If you definitely prefer to have the Excel workbook included, we ask that you allow us to document the data in both formats and include a note in the metadata clarifying that the data are indeed duplicated (but in different formats).
